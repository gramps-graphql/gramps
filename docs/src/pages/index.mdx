<PageDescription>

A thin layer of helper tools designed for the [Apollo GraphQL server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/) that allows independent data sources — a schema, resolvers, and data access model — to be composed into a single GraphQL schema, while keeping the code within each data source isolated, independently testable, and completely decoupled from the rest of your application.
